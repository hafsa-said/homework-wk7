# Question 2

*White spaces in columns - this can be cleaned using replace, or remove functions

*Format the values and characters - can be cleaned using functions like .lower() to change case, or write a conditional format checker

*Missing and duplicate values - using dropna() or fillna()

*Obsolete data - make sure theres a column to make sure we can follow last time data was updated

* Data/Organizational inconsistency - Make sure we are following all correct industry practices, and using correct data

# Autoincrementing
When creating tables, we often do not have unique identifiers within the table, hence we face difficulty in choosing Primary Key. To resolve this, we would have to manually provide unique keys to every record, a tedious task .So we can use Auto Increment feature that automatically generates a numerical Primary key value for every new record inserted. 


Subqueries return either scalar (single) values or a row set; whereas, joins return rows
